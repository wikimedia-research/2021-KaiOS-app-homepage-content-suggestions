    "\n",
    "This totals 12,033 users who would have been included in our test, or roughly 6,016 for each group. These users averaged 3.818 pageviews per active day (PPAD), with a standard deviation of 4.257. A 10% increase in PPAD would give 4.200 in the experimental group. \n",

    "My current plan is to use a [Mann–Whitney U test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mann%E2%80%93Whitney_U_test) to test the difference in PPAD. I used [G\\*Power](https://www.psychologie.hhu.de/arbeitsgruppen/allgemeine-psychologie-und-arbeitspsychologie/gpower.html) 3.1 to calculate the power achieved assuming a (1) a two-tailed test, (2) a 0.01 significance level, and (3) the minimum asymptotic relative efficiency (\"min ARE\") method (the power varies with the distribution of response variable, but this method uses the worst case scenario).\n",

It seems that KaiOS devices automatically install app updates every day by default, and indeed we see very few users running old version of the app (there has never been an app with version 0.0.0, so those users are not real):\n",
