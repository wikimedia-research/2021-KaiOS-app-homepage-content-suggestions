The Songhai Empire also occupied part of the region. The history of Nigeria has been crucially affected by the transatlantic slave trade, which started in Nigeria in the late 15th century. The first slave-trading post used by the British and Portuguese was Badagry, a coastal harbour. Local brokers provided them with slaves, escalating conflicts among the ethnic groups in the region and disrupting older trade patterns through the Trans-Saharan route.</p>",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/1743_map_of_West_Africa_by_Johann_Matthias_Hase_Cropped.jpg/295px-1743_map_of_West_Africa_by_Johann_Matthias_Hase_Cropped.jpg

It served as a British military outpost during World War II, providing financial help, munitions, and soldiers. In 1947, Tanganyika became a United Nations Trust Territory under British administration, a status it kept until its independence in 1961.

2021-04-23,TZ,5,Cyclone,90,0.1333333333333333,Cyclone,"<p>In meteorology, a <b>cyclone</b> is a large scale air mass that rotates around a strong center of low atmospheric pressure, counter-clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere as viewed from above. Cyclones are characterized by inward spiraling winds that rotate about a zone of low pressure. The largest low-pressure systems are polar vortices and extratropical cyclones of the largest scale. Warm-core cyclones such as tropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones also lie within the synoptic scale. Mesocyclones, tornadoes, and dust devils lie within smaller mesoscale. Upper level cyclones can exist without the presence of a surface low, and can pinch off from the base of the tropical upper tropospheric trough during the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere. Cyclones have also been seen on extraterrestrial planets, such as Mars, Jupiter, and Neptune. Cyclogenesis is the process of cyclone formation and intensification. Extratropical cyclones begin as waves in large regions of enhanced mid-latitude temperature contrasts called baroclinic zones. These zones contract and form weather fronts as the cyclonic circulation closes and intensifies. Later in their life cycle, extratropical cyclones occlude as cold air masses undercut the warmer air and become cold core systems. A cyclone's track is guided over the course of its 2 to 6 day life cycle by the steering flow of the subtropical jet stream.</p>",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Low_pressure_system_over_Iceland.jpg/320px-Low_pressure_system_over_Iceland.jpg

The Songhai Empire also occupied part of the region. The history of Nigeria has been crucially affected by the transatlantic slave trade, which started in Nigeria in the late 15th century. The first slave-trading post used by the British and Portuguese was Badagry, a coastal harbour. Local brokers provided them with slaves, escalating conflicts among the ethnic groups in the region and disrupting older trade patterns through the Trans-Saharan route.</p>",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/1743_map_of_West_Africa_by_Johann_Matthias_Hase_Cropped.jpg/295px-1743_map_of_West_Africa_by_Johann_Matthias_Hase_Cropped.jpg

As such; it acts to competitively inhibit the production of glucose-6-phosphate from glucose at the phosphoglucoisomerase level. In most cells, glucose hexokinase phosphorylates 2-deoxyglucose, trapping the product 2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate intracellularly ; thus, labelled forms of 2-deoxyglucose serve as a good marker for tissue glucose uptake and hexokinase activity. Many cancers have elevated glucose uptake and hexokinase levels. 2-Deoxyglucose labeled with tritium or carbon-14 has been a popular ligand for laboratory research in animal models, where distribution is assessed by tissue-slicing followed by autoradiography, sometimes in tandem with either conventional or electron microscopy.</p>",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/2-Deoxy-D-glucose.png/320px-2-Deoxy-D-glucose.png

It gradually became predominantly Muslim after the end of the Crusader period (1099-1291), during which it was the focal point of conflict between Christianity and Islam. From the 13th century it was mainly Muslim with Arabic as the dominant language and was first part of the Syrian province of the Mamluk Sultanate and after 1516 part of the Ottoman Empire until the British conquest in 1917-18.</p>",

The main crater is about two kilometres (1 mi) wide and usually contains a lava lake. The crater presently has two distinct cooled lava benches within the crater walls – one at about 3,175 m (10,417 ft) and a lower one at about 2,975 m (9,760 ft). Nyiragongo's lava lake has at times been the most voluminous known lava lake in recent history. The depth of the lava lake varies considerably. A maximum elevation of the lava lake was recorded at about 3,250 m (10,660 ft) prior to the January 1977 eruption – a lake depth of about 600 m (2,000 ft). Following the January 2002 eruption, the lava lake was recorded at a low of about 2,600 m (8,500 ft), or 900 m (3,000 ft) below the rim. The level has gradually risen since then. Nyiragongo and nearby Nyamuragira are together responsible for 40 per cent of Africa's historical volcanic eruptions.</p>",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Lava_Lake_Nyiragongo_2.jpg/320px-Lava_Lake_Nyiragongo_2.jpg

A doctor-patient relationship is a complex relationship between a doctor and a patient. This relationship is formed when a doctor attends to a patient's medical needs and is usually through consent. This unique relationship is built on trust, respect, communication, and a common understanding of both the doctor and patients' sides. The trust aspect of this relationship goes both ways, the doctor trusts the patient to reveal any information that may be relevant to the case and in turn, the patient trusts the doctor to respect their privacy and not disclose this information to outside parties. An important dynamic of this relationship is that the doctor is bonded by oath to follow certain ethical guidelines whereas the patient is not. It is important to remember that the <b>doctor–patient relationship</b> is a central part of health care and the practice of medicine. Additionally, the healthiness of a doctor-patient relationship is essential to keep the quality of the patient's healthcare high as well as to ensure that the doctor is functioning at their optimum. In more recent times healthcare has become more patient-centered and this has brought a new dynamic to this ancient relationship.</p>",

They may be provided by individual actors, private and independent organisations, or administered by a government agency. Social services are connected with the concept of welfare and the welfare state, as countries with large welfare programs often provide a wide range of social services. Social services are employed to address the wide range of needs of a society. Prior to industrialisation, the provision of social services was largely confined to private organisations and charities, with the extent of its coverage also limited. Social services are now generally regarded globally as a 'necessary function' of society and a mechanism through which governments may address societal issues.</p>",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Elementary_School_in_Boquete_Panama_05.jpg/320px-Elementary_School_in_Boquete_Panama_05.jpg
