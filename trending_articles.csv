The Songhai Empire also occupied part of the region. The history of Nigeria has been crucially affected by the transatlantic slave trade, which started in Nigeria in the late 15th century. The first slave-trading post used by the British and Portuguese was Badagry, a coastal harbour. Local brokers provided them with slaves, escalating conflicts among the ethnic groups in the region and disrupting older trade patterns through the Trans-Saharan route.</p>",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/1743_map_of_West_Africa_by_Johann_Matthias_Hase_Cropped.jpg/295px-1743_map_of_West_Africa_by_Johann_Matthias_Hase_Cropped.jpg
