The Songhai Empire also occupied part of the region. The history of Nigeria has been crucially affected by the transatlantic slave trade, which started in Nigeria in the late 15th century. The first slave-trading post used by the British and Portuguese was Badagry, a coastal harbour. Local brokers provided them with slaves, escalating conflicts among the ethnic groups in the region and disrupting older trade patterns through the Trans-Saharan route.</p>",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/1743_map_of_West_Africa_by_Johann_Matthias_Hase_Cropped.jpg/295px-1743_map_of_West_Africa_by_Johann_Matthias_Hase_Cropped.jpg

It offers watercraft a more direct route between the North Atlantic and northern Indian oceans via the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, thus avoiding the South Atlantic and southern Indian oceans and reducing the journey distance from the Arabian Sea to London by approximately 8,900 kilometres (5,500 mi), or 8 days at 24knts to 10 days at 20knts. It extends from the northern terminus of Port Said to the southern terminus of Port Tewfik at the city of Suez.
